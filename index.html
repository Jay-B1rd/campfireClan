                    <h1>Robur's Vessel</h1>
                    <p>After the clan suffered a terrible accident resulting in massive casualties, Robur became the leader of a handful of traumatized Nomai, all of them struggling in the aftermath of the disaster. Now, the clan is flourishing, well-known among the Nomai for taking in strays and those who don't fit in. They're proud of their progress, and are always looking for new faces.</p>
                    <p>Welcome to the Clan of Kindling.</p>

                        <p>Can anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference?</p>

                        <p>Hey look buddy, I'm an engineer. That means I solve problems, not problems like "What is beauty?" Because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy. I solve practical problems, for instance: how am I going to stop some mean mother Hubbard from tearing me a structurally superfluous be-hind? The answer, use a gun, and if that don't work... Use more gun. Take for instance this heavy caliber tripod mounted lil' old number designed by me, built by me, and you best hope... Not pointed at you.</p>
