                <p>
                    <em>I didn’t know back then.</em> 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    She had admitted quietly. No one was exactly meant to hear it, but here they were, standing opposite of eachother. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Her hair undone and messy, hands nervously fidgeting with the edge of her earring, and eyes tired after days of no real sleep.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    She was scared. Years and years spent denying what had happened all amounted to <em>this</em> it seemed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <em>You took my hand a- and walked me out.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Her memories were fuzzy, they always were. As time progressed they’d only get more and more muffled, mixed with fiction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <em>An ‘’emergency’’ they were yelling. We were both injured- Others were injured.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The sound of heavy things that shouldn’t break- breaking. Distant talking. Footsteps all around, quick, quick, quick, evacuate, they’ll be here soon, get out, be safe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <em>There were two other clans there to help us. They- Left me behind.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Silence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <em>You took my hand and told me to sing.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Sweet, sweet silence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <em>You promised to come find me.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    …
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <br>And there, standing in the middle of the Observatory long after lights had gone out. Almost as if preparing for a ritual, she breathed-
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <em>You saved me at the cost of your life, didn’t you?</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Somewhere, sometime, a new star was born.
