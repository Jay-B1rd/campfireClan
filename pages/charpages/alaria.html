                <p>
                    Alaria was born cursed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    At least, that’s what her parents told her. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <em>You can never let her catch you,</em> they whispered on cold nights as they huddled together, light years away from any other Nomai. <em>She will steal you away in the worst way you can imagine.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    For her mother, the worst way she could imagine was quick. One moment she was there, and the next she was gone. The planet they’d been staying on was rife with tectonic activity, and when the very ground beneath you seems intent on your demise, there isn’t much you can do but pray to the stars for mercy. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <em>You must keep going,</em> her father tells her through the tears of grief. <em>No matter how difficult it is, how much pain it causes you, you must keep going.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    For her father, it was slow. A cough, and then a limp, and then days and weeks and months of suffering and pain. He coughed blood into his hands as Alaria led him through a wasteland of a planet, setting up a distress signal and begging for a Nomai clan to reach them in time. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <em>This disease has no cure,</em> the clan’s doctor told her. <em>All we can do is ease his pain.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Alaria sat beside his deathbed, listening for his final breath. He took her hand, holding as tight as he could as he waved her close.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <em>When she catches you, she will kill you,</em> he chokes out, <em>but first she must catch you.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Her father does not take another breath. Alaria does not spend another night in that clan’s vessel. 
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:center;">~</p>


                <p>
                    Huddling in the borrowed room of a passing Nomai vessel, Alaria’s mother helps her get dressed in her pajamas. The space is unfamiliar, but Alaria’s family is here, and that is all she needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    “Tell me the story,” Alaria says. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    “You heard it just yesterday!” Her mother laughs. The way her face moves makes the scar along her nose wrinkle like spacetime around a black hole.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    “Humor her.” Her father says, a warm smile on his face. Alaria doesn’t know what he would look like without the dark circles beneath his eyes. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    “Alright, alright.” Her mother’s eyes sparkle with glee. “Come closer, sunlight. I’ll tell you the story of Cerano.”
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    Long, long ago, there was a Nomai named Cerano. He was stranded on an unknown planet when his clan unknowingly left him behind, and there he lived for years, struggling in the wildlife of a planet that seemed determined to kill him. With no other Nomai to keep him company, and stuck on a planet that hated him, Cerano fell in love with the last thing he had left. Every night, he would look up at the night sky, and profess his love to her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    What Cerano didn’t know was that the night sky loved him back. Every night she listened to his poetry and his songs, and she made her few stars shine that much brighter to light his way. Every night when the sun returned, she mourned the fact she could no longer watch over him, counting the seconds until she could reunite with him again. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    One day, Cerano decided to make her a gift. He worked during the day, and hid it during the night, keeping the project secret from his beloved. Oh, she caught a few peeks here and there, but Cerano did a good job of making sure she never knew what exactly he was working on. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Then, one night, Cerano presented his gift to her. A coat of light, made by sewing crystals into animal skin that he spent weeks perfecting. He left it on the bank of a river, and when he returned during the day, the coat was gone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    That night, the sky shone like never before. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In return, the sky gifted Cerano a star. She pulled it out of her skin and attached it to a necklace, gifting it to him as he slept under her adoring gaze. The star was blessed with a protection spell, and as long as he wore it, no harm would come to Cerano. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Then, one day, he was found.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    A Nomai clan ventured to the planet he had lived so many years of his life on, and they finally rescued him. He had his first proper bath with hot water, a full meal he didn’t have to hunt or gather himself, a comfortable bed to rest in. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This is where he found Niveus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    He called her his sun. She kept the darkness at bay, made all he had suffered worth the chance of meeting her. On their wedding day, he gifted her his star, promising it would protect her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Within a month’s time, Cerano had died. An illness he had picked up from the planet, remaining dormant until his death would be most tragic. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Niveus cried to the sky, “Why? Why must he be taken from me?” And the night sky appeared before her, her coat of stars shining cold light that made her shiver where she stood. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    “You have married a traitor,” The sky hissed, spitting fire upon her skin. “And you will suffer for it, you and the child you bear. I will hunt every single one of his kin, every member of his family, until they are nothing but stardust once more.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    “Then why haven’t you killed me where I stand?” Niveus demanded. “You are nothing but a coward. I’m not afraid of you.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    “Just because you are safe does not mean your child is. Run, little sun, or Cerano’s child will never live to see a second sunrise.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    So Niveus fled her clan, giving birth to her child hidden from the night sky. Every night, she hid from that coat of stars, and whispered the story of Cerano and the night sky to him, making him promise that he would never let his guard down, and he would never let her catch him. She gave him the star Cerano had gifted her, promising that it would protect him and to never let the night sky set her gaze upon his face. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    But children are curious, eager to disobey. One night as his mother slept, Cerano’s child wandered away from their shelter, and the night sky came down to meet him, wearing her coat of cold light.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    “My mother says you wish to kill me,” He told her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    “Your mother is right.” The night sky responded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    “But why?” Cerano’s child asked. “I have done nothing wrong.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    “Your mother does not know the full story.” The night sky told him. “I will tell you the true reason your father has cursed you so.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    And so the night sky told him of her love for Cerano, the gift he gave her, and the gift she gave in return. She told him of his betrayal, his death at her hands, and the curse his blood bears. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    “But it’s not my fault my father betrayed you.” Cerano’s son said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    “I do not care.” The night sky laughed. “That star is the only reason I do not skin you where you stand.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    It was then that Niveus finally woke and discovered her missing child. In a fit of desperation, she ran through the night, searching wildly for him. The night sky was more than happy to take the chance given to her, and Cerano’s son watched as his mother was struck down, never to rise again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    “Run, little sun.” The night sky laughed. “Or you will never live to see another sunrise.”
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    “You know, I think it might be worrying that our daughter enjoys hearing such a morbid story.” Alaria’s mother says with a teasing smile. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    “That’s just how kids are.” Her father kisses her cheek, bringing up the blanket so they could get underneath. “Sleep tight, sunlight.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    “Goodnight, mom! Goodnight, dad!” Alaria says, getting comfortable underneath the blanket. She traces the star of her necklace, falling asleep with her hands wrapped around it.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:center;">~</p>
                    <p>
                        Alaria is not a careful Nomai. She drags fish out of water, steps on other people’s feet, and is often a source of worry for the older Nomai. It’s not that she does that stuff on purpose, she’s just often moving too fast for her brain to keep up, and that tends to result in a mess.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        That’s why she takes her time as she unfolds the blanket Aerva gifted to her. The symbol of the sun shimmers, sewed with golden thread into the black backdrop. Aerva knows her story. Each thread was sewn with intent, and that makes it more valuable to Alaria than the stars themselves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The floor of her bedroom has been cleared of the mess that typically resides there. She sets the blanket down, making sure it's spread evenly across the paneling of the floor, and then kneels down in the center.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        In front of her sits a photograph of her parents. It’s singed at the edges, it has a water stain on a corner that blurs the colors, it’s crinkled, but it’s the only one she has. Myrtus helped her pick out a frame for it, where it should be safe from any further damage. Carefully, Alaria lights a candle, setting it a few inches in front of the blanket, between it and the picture frame.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        She takes a deep breath, setting her hands on her legs. Her typical dress has been replaced with loose pants, though they still have that dark blue hue. Amaryllis sewed them for her. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        “This is hard.” Alaria sighs with a quiet laugh. She quietly takes the rings off her fingers, setting them on the blanket in front of her. The bracelets follow, the earrings, and then the ring around her horn. Her hands brush over the star of her necklace. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Alaria’s hands shake as she unclasps it, setting it on the blanket. She waits, holding her breath, listening for any sign. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        She can hear music, far in the distance. She can hear talking. She can hear the ship below her, ensuring every room has a proper saturation of oxygen. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        No screaming. No alarms. No crying. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Alaria lets out her breath. Golden thread shimmers beneath her.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        “It’s nice to talk to you again.” Alaria says, staring at the picture of her parents. “I’m sorry it’s been so long. I’ve been...” She pulls at the thread of her pants. She can almost hear Amaryllis’s voice gently scolding her for trying to unravel them. She clasps her hands together instead. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        “I’m still with Robur’s Clan.” Alaria continues. “I think you’d have liked them. Aerva tells really good stories, and Myrtus has been teaching me about marine biology. They, um... They help me a lot.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Deep breath in, deep breath out. It’s okay. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        “Allia talks a lot about the stars.” She says. “She makes them seem not as scary. Which is dumb, right? I shouldn’t be scared of stars.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Alaria catches herself before she starts pulling on the threads of her pants again. She squeezes her eyes shut against the tears that threaten to fall. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        “I want to <em>stay.</em>” Alaria whispers. “I want to stay here. I know what you told me, over and over again, but I don’t—” Her voice wavers. “I can’t do it this time. I can’t leave them behind.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The light of the candle flickers, and Alaria can feel tears staining the fur of her face. She takes in measured breaths, hands hovering near the warmth of the flame like it could be any substitute for the warmth of her parents beside her. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        “I think I can stay this time.” Alaria says. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        “I think I can stay this time.” Alaria repeats, steadying her voice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        “I can stay.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        “I <em>will</em> stay.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Alaria pulls her hands away from the candle before it burns her fingers like it’s done so many times before. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Deep breath in, deep breath out. It’s okay.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        “I can stay, because,” Alaria brushes her hand against the star of her necklace, “I think I found the sun.”
                        </p>
