                <p>
                    Amaryllis was born a few days/weeks before the crash, barely having come into the world before suffering a horrible loss. One of her parents (I haven’t decided who) shielded her with their body during the crash, holding on just long enough to ensure she got rescued before succumbing to their injuries. It’s a miracle she survived.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    She’s the spitting image of her mother Lily, with some of her coloration coming from her father, Kaffir. She wears some of their jewelry, her father’s earrings, and her mother’s bracelet. Her everyday jewelry changes from day to day, but she always wears their wedding rings on her horns. The rings are a little battered, scratched and dinged up, but she wouldn’t have them any other way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Soleiro was making a dress for her mother before the crash, and it was half finished when it occurred. Soleiro finished the dress and gave it to Amaryllis when she was older, and it’s one of her most prized possessions. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The ghosts of her parents watch over her, they were a constant when she was little, but as she grows older, they appear less and less. They never leave her though. When she’s in that half-asleep state that verges on sleep, she can faintly feel her parents tucking her in. She never remembers this, as it occurs just before she slips into the realm of dreams. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    She was raised communally by the clan, with the various adults gaining the titles of “mother/father/papa/momma” and other such variations. “Mom” and “Dad” are exclusively used for her parents though. Those around her age gain the titles of “brother” and “sister”, and a few of the older members gain the titles of “grandpa” and “grandma”, Soleiro gaining the title of “grandma” first. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    When Loni joins the clan, she’s beyond excited. She was always the youngest, so for the first time having someone younger than her exites her. When she holds baby Loni for the first time, she finally understands why everyone went above and beyond for her when she was a baby. Logically, she already knew it, but this is the first time she <em>understands </em>it. She cries upon holding Loni for the first time, absolutely adoring the little infant. She declares herself Loni’s big sister, and she takes that title VERY seriously.
