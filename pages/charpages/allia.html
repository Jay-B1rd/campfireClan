            <div class="story mainbadge">
                <p>Allia and her family came from a clan where the population was much bigger and more bustling than that of Robur's clan. With so many Nomai, adults and children alike, Allia had difficulty interacting with others and lacked the confidence to put herself out there.</p>
                
                <p>Additionally, she also had an ability that she calls her 'Ghost Sight' that makes her see ghosts of deceased Nomai. This doesn't help at all with Allia's existing social anxiety. In fact, it may have made it worse because very few people seemed to believe her when she says that she can see ghosts. While others weren't outwardly hostile towards her nor was she shunned for having this ability, Allia would hear others talk about her in hushed tones when they think they can't hear her. This causes Allia to withdraw into herself even more.</p>

                <p>Her parents are neutral on their belief of Allia's ability and cared far more for her wellbeing, deciding that the best option for Allia is to move to another, much smaller clan where Allia can feel less overwhelmed and hopefully encourage her to open up more to the Nomai around her. During one of the Festivals, Allia's family made arrangements to move in with Robur's clan, after hearing of how his clan welcomes those who don't quite fit in with their own clans.</p>

                <p>Much to Allia's horror though, Allia would soon learn that Robur's clan had faced a tragedy many years prior that resulted in significant loss and death in his clan. So now she sees many of the ghosts of the deceased clan members lost to that tragedy. However, she would also soon discover that the members of Robur's clan respond in a less judgemental way once she shares with others about her ghost sight.</p>

                <p>The second problem Allia would face is the disconnect she feels with the rest of the clan, especially with their leader, Robur. As many members of the clan seem to share a lot of history with each other and their leader, while Allia struggled to form connections and is unused to the welcoming and warm community of this clan.</p>

                <p>It will take time for her to slowly acclimate and get comfortable in Robur's clan, but with the support of her family and the welcoming community, she has a good first step in the right direction.</p>
